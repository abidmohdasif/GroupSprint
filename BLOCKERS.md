Blocker 1 Data & Time: Day 1, 9:40-10:40 am (First Period)
Blocker: We weren't sure what game to make or what direction to go in design-wise.
Impact: Made us spend longer than possibly some other groups, which knew exactly what they were going to do, left us all scrambling.
Resolution: WE started spitballing ideas until something stuck, and we ended up going with a simple Tamagotchi-esque game.
Time to resolve: 25 Minutes
Root Cause: Nobody wants to step on each other's toes and kind of take control of the group/not much creativity.
